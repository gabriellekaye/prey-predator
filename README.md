# Prey-Predator Model

Asynchronous learning task for CMPLXSY

* Prey: Rabbits

Rabbits can eat carrots or grass so they do not starve to death. Grass and carrots regenerate after a set time so the rabbits do not run out of food.
  
* Predator: Fox

Foxes must eat rabbits to not starve to death.

Rabbits and foxes can reproduce, with rabbits having a higher reproduction rate than foxes. Both animals also lose energy every time they move. When their energy reaches 0, they die.
